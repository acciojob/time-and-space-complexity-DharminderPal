   <h1>Time Space and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. 
        Efficient algorithms are designed to minimize the time it takes to solve a problem, especially for large inputs. 
        Time complexity is usually expressed in Big-O notation to describe the upper bound of the running time.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. 
        Just like time complexity, space complexity is expressed in terms of Big-O notation. An algorithm with space complexity 
        of O(n) means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the size of the input.
