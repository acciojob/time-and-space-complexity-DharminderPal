    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps us evaluate the efficiency of algorithms. It provides a way to express the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of the input data. Understanding time complexity is essential for developing efficient algorithms that can handle large datasets effectively.</p>
    
    <p>Another important aspect of algorithm analysis is <b>Space Complexity</b>, which refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. Space complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates how the memory requirements grow with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms not only consider time but also the space they utilize.</p>
